# Precipitation_Time_Series

## Background

### Rainfall is a complex meteorological process that affects ecosystems and human quality of life. The impact of rainfall is especially important for urban centers with dense populations. One percent of geographic land is characterized as a major city (Shepherd, 2005), but about 80% of the population lives in cities in the United States (US Census Bureau, 2022). In highly populated urban areas, rainfall has been found to be enhanced within and near city centers (Liu & Niyogi, 2019). This may be related to urban microclimates caused by city characteristics such as increased temperatures from vehicle emissions (Liu & Niyogi, 2019). Thus, the ability to predict rainfall events can aid in disaster and urban planning to proactively protect flood zones and build resilient infrastructure. Proactive measures can prevent unnecessary infrastructure damage as a result of standing water. Using historical data, time series models can be trained to predict expected rainfall for future time periods. According to the United States Census Bureau (2022), the top three states with the most urban centers are California, Texas, and Florida. While Texas and Florida are known for regular hurricane and rain events, California is starting to experience periods of heavy rainfall and mild hurricanes as well. The combination of wildfires, drought periods, and rain events put California at risk for flooding (Touma et al., 2022) and long-standing water.   

## Method
### Rainfall and temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is used here as a data-rich resource for city-level rainfall and temperature data. This data will be used to create time series models that forecast future rainfall events in San Diego.

## Results
### It was found that San Diego is a rain-dominant climate, with the rainiest seasons being fall and winter. Based on historical data, rain events occur over 76% of the time, with 23% of events having potential for long-standing water (above 0.5 inch). The precipitation pattern in San Diego is quite regular, with a yearly forecast predicting a similar pattern to historical seasonality.
